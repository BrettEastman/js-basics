//Set objects are collections of values. A value in the Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order. The insertion order corresponds to the order in which each element was inserted into the set by the add() method successfully (that is, there wasn't an identical element already in the set when add() was called).

//Constructor
Set() //Creates a new Set object

//Instance properties
Set.prototype.size //Returns the number of values in the Set object. For sets, this is what you use instead of the .length method for arrays and strings.

//Instance methods
Set.prototype.add(value)  //Inserts a new element with a specified value in to a Set object, if there isn't an element with the same value already in the Set.

Set.prototype.clear()  //Removes all elements from the Set object.

Set.prototype.delete(value)  //Removes the element associated to the value and returns a boolean asserting whether an element was successfully removed or not. Set.prototype.has(value) will return false afterwards.

Set.prototype.has(value)  //Returns a boolean asserting whether an element is present with the given value in the Set object or not.

//MDN example:
const mySet1 = new Set()

mySet1.add(1)           // Set [ 1 ]
mySet1.add(5)           // Set [ 1, 5 ]
mySet1.add(5)           // Set [ 1, 5 ]
mySet1.add('some text') // Set [ 1, 5, 'some text' ]
const o = {a: 1, b: 2}
mySet1.add(o)

mySet1.add({a: 1, b: 2})   // o is referencing a different object, so this is okay

mySet1.has(1)              // true
mySet1.has(3)              // false, since 3 has not been added to the set
mySet1.has(5)              // true
mySet1.has(Math.sqrt(25))  // true
mySet1.has('Some Text'.toLowerCase()) // true
mySet1.has(o)       // true

mySet1.size         // 5

mySet1.delete(5)    // removes 5 from the set
mySet1.has(5)       // false, 5 has been removed

mySet1.size         // 4, since we just removed one value

mySet1.add(5)       // Set [1, 'some text', {...}, {...}, 5] - a previously deleted item will be added as a new item, it will not retain its original position before deletion

console.log(mySet1)
// logs Set(5) [ 1, "some text", {…}, {…}, 5 ] in Firefox
// logs Set(5) { 1, "some text", {…}, {…}, 5 } in Chrome
